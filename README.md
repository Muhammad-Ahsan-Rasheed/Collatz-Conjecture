# Collatz-Conjecture
In this repo I tried to develop software (a set of functions) that can be used to investigate/research the unsolved mathematical problem called Collatz Conjecture. Although the problem is considered to be very difficult, its formulation can be understood by a school student.

Collatz Conjecture
Collatz Conjecture: Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer, n, which we denote f(n):

If the number n is even, then f(n) = n/2.
If the number n is odd, f(n) = 3*n + 1.
Now form a sequence (a Collatz sequence) by performing this operation repeatedly, beginning with a positive integer, n, and taking the result at each step as the input at the next. You stop once you reach 1.
